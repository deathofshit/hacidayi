Trebuchet Launcher by Cyanogenmod, modified to build in Android Studio as a standalone application.

You will need to add your own signing information, as for obvious reasons the linked one is not included in this repository. Other than that, it should all just work.

A built version is available on the Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaneoriley.cyanogenport.launcher3
